# multiclass-diabetes-ova-logreg
Multiclass diabetes prediction with a from-scratch one-vs-all logistic regression (non-diabet, pre-diabet, diabet). Includes data loading, normalization, gradient descent, accuracy + confusion matrix, and a cost-curve plot. Notes current limitation: weak recall on pre-diabet due to imbalance.
